            <h2>6,000 families just lost their paycheck to a line of code.</h2>

<p>Heineken is axing 7% of its global workforce to "save money" with AI. The CEO just admitted on CNBC that humans are being traded for "productivity savings." If you think your office chair is safe, you are dreaming.</p>

<p>At AI Core Logic, we track the digital bloodletting of the Fortune 500. This isn't a "trend"—it's a corporate execution of the old guard. Read on to see why your job is likely next on the chopping block.</p>

<h2>The Great Heineken Purge: 6,000 Jobs Deleted</h2>

<p><b>Heineken is slashing up to 6,000 positions</b> worldwide as beer sales plummet. The brewing giant is pivoting to AI-driven automation to protect its bottom line. This massive layoff represents roughly 7% of its entire global staff.</p>

<p>CEO Dolf van den Brink confirmed that AI is now the primary engine for "ongoing productivity savings." They aren't just brewing beer anymore. They are brewing a future where human employees are an expensive liability.</p>

<h3>The Cold Reality of Corporate "Efficiency"</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Sales are tanking:</b> Rising costs and lower demand are squeezed margins.</li>
    <li><b>AI is the scapegoat:</b> Machines don't ask for raises, benefits, or vacations.</li>
    <li><b>The "7% Rule":</b> Heineken is just the first domino in the massive beverage sector collapse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Boss Is Looking For Your Replacement Right Now</h2>

<p>Don't be fooled by the "productivity" jargon. That is corporate-speak for <b>"You are too expensive."</b> Every hour you spend on manual tasks is an hour a $20/month AI tool can do in seconds.</p>

<p>Heineken isn't the outlier; they are the blueprint. Boards of directors across the globe are salivating at the thought of cutting 7% of their overhead with a software update. If your daily output can be mapped by a flowchart, you are already redundant.</p>

<h2>Stop Being a Victim of the Algorithm</h2>

<p>The middle class is being hollowed out by scripts and LLMs. You cannot outwork a machine that never sleeps. You cannot "hustle" your way out of a corporate restructuring. The only way to survive is to <b>own the tools</b> that are currently coming for your job.</p>

<p>You either become the person who manages the AI, or you become the person replaced by it. There is no third option. The "Heineken 6,000" didn't see this coming until the email hit their inbox. You don't have that excuse.</p>

<h3>How to AI-Proof Your Income</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Master the Stack:</b> Learn the specific AI tools disrupting your niche today.</li>
    <li><b>Leverage Logic:</b> Focus on strategy and high-level decision-making.</li>
    <li><b>Get Guided:</b> Don't guess which tools matter. Get a roadmap.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Clock is Ticking for Your Career</h2>

<p>This is the biggest shift in labor since the Industrial Revolution. The "Beer Slump" was just the excuse Heineken needed to pull the trigger. Your company is likely waiting for their excuse right now.</p>

<p>Will you be the one wielding the AI tool, or the one being deleted by it?</p>
