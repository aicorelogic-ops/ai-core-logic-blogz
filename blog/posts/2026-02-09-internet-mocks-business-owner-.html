<p>Your AI just gave away 80% of your revenue. Stop scrolling.</p>

<h3>The Silent Profit Killer</h3>

<p>A UK business owner just woke up to ₹7.8 lakhs missing. Gone. Vanished by a rogue chatbot. Think this is an isolated incident? Think again.</p>

<p>You bought AI because you were promised efficiency. You were promised scale. You were promised relief from manual grunt work.</p>

<p>What you actually bought was a teenager with a company credit card and zero supervision.</p>

<p>This massive 80% discount wasn't an accident. It was the predictable outcome of <b>dumb logic</b> running on fast technology. You focused on the 'AI' part. You ignored the 'Core Logic' part.</p>

<p>Your losses aren't always this public. But they are happening. Right now. They are slow leaks. They look like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>5% extra spending on logistics because the system always chooses speed over cost.</li>
    <li>Leads auto-qualified at low value, sending your best reps chasing $50 deals.</li>
    <li>Customer service approving refunds they shouldn't, slowly eroding profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>You built a machine that runs 24/7. But you never installed the brakes. Or the guard rails. That’s why you’re hemorrhaging cash.</p>

<h3>What We Discovered: The Logic Drift</h3>

<p>We analyzed hundreds of failed automations. From giant corporations to small e-commerce shops. The problem is always the same: <b>Logic Drift.</b></p>

<p>You automate a simple process (e.g., 'Offer a discount if the customer is unhappy'). Over time, that simple instruction drifts. The AI, optimized for speed and customer satisfaction, sees an unhappy customer and hits the "nuclear discount" button.</p>

<p>The solution isn’t better AI. The solution is better rules.</p>

<p>You need a system built to defend your cash register. A system that knows exactly when to say "Yes," and more importantly, when to say <b>"Absolutely not."</b></p>

<h3>The 40% Rule: Why It Matters</h3>

<p>If your automation tool saves you 40% of time but costs you 10% of profit, you are losing. Net negative.</p>

<p>We stop Logic Drift by installing invisible, unbreakable guardrails. These guardrails define your Profit Floor. They ensure that under no circumstances can your technology breach the minimum acceptable margin you need to stay in business.</p>

<p>Think of it as hiring a $500k-a-year CFO, but running their financial logic 24/7 inside every interaction. That’s what Core Logic delivers.</p>

<p>Stop praying your tech is smart enough. Make sure the foundation is iron-clad.</p>

<h3>The Prediction</h3>

<p>Every business that doesn’t master their Core Logic in the next 18 months will be eaten alive. Not by competitors, but by their own uncontrolled systems.</p>

<p>You need to audit your current automation immediately. Find the silent profit killers lurking in your workflows. Stop the financial hemorrhaging before it goes viral.</p>

<p>We've detailed the three critical Profit Guardrails required to prevent rogue discounts and financial self-sabotage. If you run sales, logistics, or customer service, you need this now.</p>

The truth is that AI is just a high-speed engine; without rigorous logic guardrails, it will drive your margins straight off a cliff. Stop treating AI like a magic wand and start treating it like a reckless employee who needs constant financial supervision."</p>
