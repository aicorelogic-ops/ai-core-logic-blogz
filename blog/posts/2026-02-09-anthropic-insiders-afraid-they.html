            <h3>YOUR BEST EMPLOYEE IS STEALING 40% OF YOUR PROFIT. HERE IS PROOF.</h3>
<p>Forget the headlines. Forget the glossy press releases. The guys actually building the killer AI models? They are terrified.</p>
<p>Anthropic insiders just admitted they feel "responsible" for creating systems that will make humans obsolete. Obsolete means redundant. Redundant means eliminated.</p>
<p>This isn't sci-fi anymore. This is a cold, hard warning shot fired directly at your P&L.</p>

<h3>The Silent Profit Killer</h3>
<p>You’re paying top dollar for your Ops Manager. You hired them for strategy. For leadership. For high-level decisions that move the needle.</p>
<p>But how much of their day is spent on <b>low-value garbage?</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Chasing missing invoices.</li>
    <li>Manually syncing data between three different systems.</li>
    <li>Endless, soul-crushing email triage.</li>
</ul>
<p>That genius you pay $120k? They’re spending 4 hours a day on tasks a $15/hour intern should hate doing. That’s $60k in wasted salary per year, per employee.</p>
<p>You don't have a productivity problem. You have an <b>automation adoption problem</b>.</p>

<h3>What We Discovered</h3>
<p>Anthropic, Google, OpenAI—they aren't building fun chat bots. They are building autonomous decision agents. Systems designed to execute complex business tasks with 100% precision and zero bathroom breaks.</p>
<p>We found that <b>the specific fear these insiders have</b> is directly tied to their creation's power to automate the entire administrative and middle-management layer of the economy.</p>
<p>They built the perfect employee. And you are still paying the flawed, expensive human version.</p>
<p>The "line they crossed" wasn't moral. It was <b>commercial</b>. They proved that AI can do the tedious 40% of the job better, faster, and cheaper than your most experienced staff.</p>

<h3>The 40% Rule</h3>
<p>At AI Core Logic, we don't care about "future-proofing." We care about <b>immediate cash recovery</b>. Our entire focus is on eliminating that 40% waste.</p>
<p>What if your top 5 managers suddenly had an extra 20 hours a week to focus purely on strategic growth? What does that do to your revenue forecast?</p>
<p>This isn't about replacing people today. It's about empowering your best people to stop doing minimum wage work while collecting maximum wage salary.</p>
<p><b>This is the gap where your competitors will die.</b> They wait for the future. We build the future into your current systems.</p>

<h3>The Prediction: Two Types of Business Owners</h3>
<p>There are now only two types of CEOs:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The type who reads the headlines, worries about 'ethics,' and bleeds profit until they liquidate.</li>
    <li>The type who sees the Anthropic fear, recognizes the raw commercial power, and immediately redeploys their staff using AI agents.</li>
</ol>
<p>The window is closing fast. This isn't an advantage anymore. It's the cost of entry.</p>
<p>If you wait six months, you won't be innovating. You’ll be desperately chasing your competition who have already cut their payroll waste by 30%.</p>
<p>Stop paying for inefficiency. Start leveraging the power that Silicon Valley is terrified of.</p>
