            <h3>$7 Million Down the Drain (And Your Dispatcher is Next)</h3>
<p>Last night, the biggest tech giants on the planet spent <b>$7 million for 30 seconds</b> of your time. They showed you talking robots, flashy interfaces, and "magic" buttons. They failed miserably.</p>
<p>While the rest of the world was crying over puppy commercials, these AI pioneers were burning cash faster than a freight truck with a hole in the fuel tank. They wanted your "attention." They forgot about your <b>bottom line.</b></p>

<h3>The Silent Profit Killer</h3>
<p>Most AI today is a toy. It is built by guys in Silicon Valley who have never stepped foot on a warehouse floor or dealt with a broken supply chain. They want "engagement." You want <b>efficiency.</b></p>
<p>Your business is leaking money. It happens every single hour. It happens when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your dispatcher spends 3 hours on a 10-minute task.</li>
    <li>Your trucks sit idle because of a scheduling "hiccup."</li>
    <li>Your margins are eaten by manual data entry errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the "shiny" AI you saw on TV to run a logistics business is like trying to fix a diesel engine with a plastic spoon. It looks cute, but it’s <b>useless.</b></p>

<h3>The 40% Rule</h3>
<p>What we discovered is shocking. We call it <b>The 40% Rule.</b> Roughly 40% of all logistics operational costs are hidden in "micro-inefficiencies" that general AI simply cannot see. The Super Bowl ads focused on writing poems and making fake art. They didn't solve the fact that your cost-per-mile is climbing while your competitors are automating your lunch.</p>

<h3>Why This Matters to Your Business</h3>
<p>The "Big Tech Fumble" is your biggest opportunity. While your competitors are distracted by the hype, you can implement <b>Core Logic.</b> This isn't about "chatting" with a bot. It’s about hard data. It’s about predictive maintenance that actually predicts and routing that actually routes. If your AI doesn't put dollars back in your bank account this month, it's just an expensive hobby.</p>

<h3>The Cold, Hard Prediction</h3>
<p>Here is where this is headed: 90% of the AI companies you saw on that screen will be bankrupt or "pivoting" by Q4. Why? Because <b>hype doesn't pay the bills.</b> The market is about to punish companies that chose "laughter and tears" over logic and ROI. The winners will be the logistics leaders who ignored the commercials and focused on the core logic of their operations.</p>
