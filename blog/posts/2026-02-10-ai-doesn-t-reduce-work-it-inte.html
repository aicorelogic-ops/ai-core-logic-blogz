            <h3>Your Top Dispatcher Is 90 Days From A Total Meltdown</h3>

<p>Think your new AI tools are saving you time? <b>You’re being lied to.</b></p>

<p>While everyone else is celebrating "efficiency," your best people are <b>drowning</b> in a sea of new tasks. They aren't working less. They are working faster, harder, and longer than they ever did before the "solution" arrived.</p>

<h3>The High-Speed Burnout Trap</h3>

<p>In logistics, speed is everything. But there’s a <b>hidden cost</b> to the AI revolution that no one is talking about. It’s called <b>Workload Creep</b>.</p>

<p>When you give a planner or a warehouse manager an AI tool, they don't take a longer lunch. They don't go home at 5 PM. Instead, they fill that "saved" time with <b>three more tasks</b>. They expand their scope. They start answering emails at midnight because the AI made it "easier" to keep going.</p>

<p>This isn't productivity. It's a <b>death march</b> for your margins.</p>

<h3>What We Discovered</h3>

<p>New research proves that AI tools consistently <b>intensify</b> work rather than reducing it. Your team is redlining their engines. They are taking on more responsibility without being asked. Eventually, the engine <b>blows</b>.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Decision Fatigue:</b> More data means more choices. More choices lead to $20,000 routing mistakes and missed deliveries.</li>
<li><b>The Turnover Tax:</b> Replacing a senior logistics manager costs 2x their annual salary. AI is making your best talent want to quit <b>today</b>.</li>
<li><b>Quality Decay:</b> Fast work is often sloppy work. Your customers will notice the drop in service long before you see it in your spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The 18-Month Prediction</h3>

<p>Here is the hard truth: Within 18 months, the companies that treat AI as a "work intensifier" will be <b>out of business</b>. They will lose their best talent to competitors who actually understand <b>AI Core Logic</b>.</p>

<p>The winners won't use AI to squeeze more hours out of people. They will use it to create <b>intentional pauses</b> and human grounding in their supply chain. They will prioritize sustainable output over a 30-day "productivity surge" that kills morale.</p>

<h3>Why This Matters To YOUR Business</h3>

<p>If you don't set standards now, your AI implementation will <b>cannibalize</b> your profits. You’ll have a faster team that makes more mistakes, hates their jobs, and looks for the exit. </p>

<p><b>Is that the "automated" business you wanted to build?</b></p>

<p>Don't let "efficiency" kill your company from the inside out.</p>
