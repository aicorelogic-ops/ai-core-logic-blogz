            <h3>Your Top Dispatcher Is 90 Days From A Total Meltdown</h3>

<p>Think your new AI tools are saving you time? <b>You’re being lied to.</b></p>

<p>While everyone else is celebrating "efficiency," your best people are <b>drowning</b> in a sea of new tasks. They aren't working less. They are working faster, harder, and longer than they ever did before the "solution" arrived.</p>

<h3>The High-Speed Burnout Trap</h3>

<p>In logistics, speed is everything. But there’s a <b>hidden cost</b> to the AI revolution that no one is talking about. It’s called <b>Workload Creep</b>.</p>

<p>When you give a planner or a warehouse manager an AI tool, they don't take a longer lunch. They don't go home at 5 PM. Instead, they fill that "saved" time with <b>three more tasks</b>. They expand their scope. They start answering emails at midnight because the AI made it "easier" to keep going.</p>

<p>This isn't productivity. It's a <b>death march</b> for your margins.</p>

<h3>What We Discovered</h3>

<p>New research proves that AI tools consistently <b>intensify</b> work rather than reducing it. Your team is redlining their engines. They are taking on more responsibility without being asked. Eventually, the engine <b>blows</b>.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Decision Fatigue:</b> More data means more choices. More choices lead to $20,000 routing mistakes and missed deliveries.</li>
<li><b>The Turnover Tax:</b> Replacing a senior logistics manager costs 2x their annual salary. AI is making your best talent want to quit <b>today</b>.</li>
<li><b>Quality Decay:</b> Fast work is often sloppy work. Your customers will notice the drop in service long before you see it in your spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The 18-Month Prediction</h3>

<p>Here is the hard truth: Within 18 months, the companies that treat AI as a "work intensifier" will be <b>out of business</b>. They will lose their best talent to competitors who actually understand <b>AI Core Logic</b>.</p>

<p>The winners won't use AI to squeeze more hours out of people. They will use it to create <b>intentional pauses</b> and human grounding in their supply chain. They will prioritize sustainable output over a 30-day "productivity surge" that kills morale.</p>

<h3>Why This Matters To YOUR Business</h3>

<p>If you don't set standards now, your AI implementation will <b>cannibalize</b> your profits. You’ll have a faster team that makes more mistakes, hates their jobs, and looks for the exit. </p>

<p><b>Is that the "automated" business you wanted to build?</b></p>

<p>Don't let "efficiency" kill your company from the inside out.</p>

The real truth is that automation often creates a "turnover tax" that cannibalizes your profits through burnout and sloppy mistakes. Sustainable winners will use AI to provide human breathing room rather than squeezing every last second out of their staff."</p>
