# ai.corelogic Visual Style Guide

## Global Aesthetic
- **Tone:** High-tech, authoritative, and data-centric.
- **Style:** Professional AI & Tech news graphics. 

## Image Layout Requirements
1. **Headlines:** Bold, white sans-serif text in the bottom third. 
2. **Highlighting:** Use #ai.corelogic brand yellow (or standard bright yellow) to highlight keywords like "AI", "Elon Musk", or "Record-Breaking".
3. **Picture-in-Picture:** - Use a circular inset for "Key Figures" (like industry CEOs).
    - Use a square/rectangular inset if showing a "Truth Social" post or a code snippet.
4. **Watermarking:** Place a small, clean "ai.corelogic" text or logo in the top right corner, similar to the ABC7/Variety examples.
5. **Backgrounds:** Use high-resolution imagery of hardware, clean EV designs, or professional portraits. 

## Content Rules
- Every image MUST correspond to the technical nature of the caption.
- Avoid generic "robotic hand" AI tropes; focus on real-world tech impact.
