# Facebook Posting Guardrails

## Context
When posting to a Facebook Page, the agent must ensure the post appears on the main Page Feed/Timeline, not just in the media gallery or as an unpublished 'Dark Post'.

## Mandatory Actions
- **Explicit Publishing:** You MUST click the final "Post", "Publish Now", or "Share" button. Do not consider the task complete after just the "Upload" step.
- **Feed Verification:** After posting, you MUST navigate to the Page's main URL (e.g., facebook.com/YourPageName) and verify that the post appears at the top of the feed.
- **Artifact Evidence:** Take a screenshot of the post appearing on the public timeline as the "Completion Artifact".

## Troubleshooting
- If the post appears in "Photos" but not on the "Home" feed, go to Meta Business Suite > Content and click "Publish" on the item manually.
- Always ensure the "Public" visibility is selected before clicking Post.
